## Project 1:   

  ### Description:  
  This project implements three types of **Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)** classifiers in Python using NumPy. These classifiers fall into two classes based on multivariate Gaussian distributions, using different assumptions about the covariance structure.
  

  ### Features:  
  - Implements three GDA classifiers:
    1. **C1**: Class-specific full covariance matrices
    2. **C2**: Shared full covariance matrix
    3. **C3**: Shared diagonal covariance matrix
   - Reads training and test datsets from '.txt' files
   - Computes precision and recall for model evaluation

  ### Concepts used:
  - Multivariate Gaussian Distributions
  - Maximum Liklihood Estimation
  - Discriminant Funtions
  - Covariance Matrix Analysis
  - Performance Metrics (Precision, Recall) 
  
  ### How to Run:
  1. compile all and run hw1.py

## Project 2: Clustering and Dimension Reduction for Handritten Digit Classification

  ### Description:
  This project implements a pipeline combining K-Means Clustering and Principal Cp,[pmemy Analysis (PCA) for classification of handwritten digit images (0, 8 , and 9) from digits089.csv


  ### Features:
  - Implementation of K-means algorithm
  - Implementation of PCA
  - Classification based on majority voting within clusters
  - Evaluation of clustering performance on:
    1. High dimensional data
    2. PCA-reduced data with >95% variance
    3. PCA-reduced data to a single dimension
  - Visualization of reconstruction error over iterations
  
  
  ### How to Run:
  1. compile all and run hw2.py
