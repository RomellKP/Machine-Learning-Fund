## Project 1:   

  ### Description:  
  This project implements three types of **Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)** classifiers in Python using NumPy. These classifiers fall into two classes based on multivariate Gaussian distributions, using different assumptions about the covariance structure.
  

  ### Features:  
  - Implements three GDA classifiers:
    1. **C1**: Class-specific full covariance matrices
    2. **C2**: Shared full covariance matrix
    3. **C3**: Shared diagonal covariance matrix
   - Reads training and test datsets from '.txt' files
   - Computes precision and recall for model evaluation

  ### Concepts used:
  - Multivariate Gaussian Distributions
  - Maximum Liklihood Estimation
  - Discriminant Funtions
  - Covariance Matrix Analysis
  - Performance Metrics (Precision, Recall)
